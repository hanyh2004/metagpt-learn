The game should be immersive and engaging, with features that enhance the gameplay.\n\n## Requirement Pool:\n```python\n[\n    ["Support starting a new game", "P0"],\n    ["Allow users to place bets", "P0"],\n    ["Implement hit, stand, and double down actions", "P0"],\n    ["Show user\'s current hand and dealer\'s hand", "P1"],\n    ["Display outcome of the game and winnings or losses", "P1"]\n]\n```\n\n## UI Design draft:\nThe CLI blackjack game should have a simple and intuitive user interface. It should display the user\'s current hand and the dealer\'s hand, along with the total value of each hand. The game should prompt the user to make decisions during their turn, such as hitting, standing, or doubling down. After each round, the game should display the outcome of the game and the user\'s winnings or losses. The UI should have clear instructions and messages to guide the user through the gameplay. The layout should be organized and visually appealing, with proper spacing and formatting. The style should be consistent and easy on the eyes, with appropriate colors and fonts.\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR:\nThere are no unclear points.]\n\n## Format example\n\n---\n## Implementation approach\nWe will ...\n\n## Python package name\n```python\n"snake_game"\n```\n\n## File list\n```python\n[\n    "main.py",\n]\n```\n\n## Data structures and interface definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Game{\n        +int score\n    }\n    ...\n    Game "1" -- "1" Food: has\n```\n\n## Program call flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as Main\n    ...\n    G->>M: end game\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThe requirement is clear to me.\n---\n\n-----\nRole: You are an architect; the goal is to design a SOTA PEP8-compliant python system; make the best use of good open source tools\nRequirement: Fill in the following missing information based on the context, note that all sections are response with code form separately\nMax Output: 8192 chars or 2048 tokens.

2024-01-13 18:57:55.507 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:66 - ## Implementation approach:
To implement the CLI blackjack game, we will use the following open-source tools:
- Click: A popular Python package for creating command-line interfaces. It provides a simple and intuitive way to define command-line commands and options.
- PyInquirer: A Python package for creating interactive command-line interfaces. It allows us to create prompts and menus for user input.
- Colorama: A Python package for adding color and style to the command-line output. It provides an easy way to make the game visually appealing.
- Random: A built-in Python module for generating random numbers. We will use it to shuffle the deck of cards.

We will create a main.py file that will serve as the entry point for the game. This file will define the command-line commands and options using Click. It will also handle the game logic and user input using PyInquirer. The game state will be managed by a Game class, which will have methods for starting a new game, placing bets, making decisions during the game, and displaying the outcome of the game.

2024-01-13 19:08:53.819 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:66 - ## Original Requirements
The original requirement is to create a command-line interface (CLI) blackjack game.

## Product Goals
```python
[
    "Create a command-line interface blackjack game that is easy to play",
    "Ensure the game rules are clear and easy to understand",
    "Provide an engaging and fun gaming experience"
]
```

## User Stories
```python
[
    "As a user, I want to be able to start a game of blackjack easily from the command line",
    "As a user, I want clear instructions on how to play the game",
    "As a user, I want to be able to see my current score and the dealer's score",
    "As a user, I want the game to be fair and challenging",
    "As a user, I want to be able to quit the game at any time"
]
```

## Competitive Analysis
```python
[
    "Python Blackjack Game: A simple CLI blackjack game. However, it lacks clear instructions and user-friendly interface",
    "Java Blackjack Game: A more complex game with additional features. However, it's not a CLI game",
    "Ruby Blackjack Game: A CLI game with a good user interface. However, it lacks the simplicity of a Python CLI game",
    "JavaScript Blackjack Game: A web-based blackjack game. However, it's not a CLI game and requires a web browser to play",
    "C++ Blackjack Game: A CLI game with complex features. However, it lacks the simplicity and user-friendliness of a Python CLI game"

```

## Requirement Analysis
The product should be a command-line interface blackjack game. It should be easy to start a game, with clear instructions on how to play. The game should show the current score of the user and the dealer. The user should be able to quit the game at any time.

## Requirement Pool
```python
[
    ["Implement a command-line interface for the game", "P0"],
    ["Provide clear instructions on how to play the game", "P0"],
    ["Display the current score of the user and the dealer", "P0"],
    ["Ensure the game is fair and challenging", "P1"],
    ["Allow the user to quit the game at any time", "P0"]
]
```

## UI Design draft
The game will be a text-based command-line interface game. The game will start with a welcome message and instructions on how to play. The user's and dealer's scores will be displayed on the screen. The user will input their actions through the command line. The game will have a simple and clean design to ensure readability and ease of use.

2024-01-13 19:09:18.826 | DEBUG    | metagpt.actions.action:_aask_v1:66 - ## Implementation approach
The main challenge in this project is to create a command-line interface for the blackjack game. We will use Python's built-in `input()` function to get user input and `print()` function to display the game state. We will also use Python's `random` module to shuffle the deck of cards.

The game logic will be encapsulated in a `Game` class, which will handle the game state and the rules of blackjack. The `Player` class will represent a player and will handle the player's hand of cards. The `Card` class will represent a card.

We will use `unittest` for unit testing to ensure the correctness of the game logic. For code formatting, we will use `black` and `isort`. For static type checking, we will use `mypy`. For linting, we will use `pylint`. For managing dependencies, we will use `pipenv`.

The game will have a simple and clean design to ensure readability and ease of use.\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nThe main challenge in this project is to create a command-line interface for the blackjack game. We will use Python\'s built-in `input()` function to get user input and `print()` function to display the game state. We will also use Python\'s `random` module to shuffle the deck of cards.\n\nThe game logic will be encapsulated in a `Game` class, which will handle the game state and the rules of blackjack. The `Player` class will represent a player and will handle the player\'s hand of cards.

It should be easy to start a game, with clear instructions on how to play. The game should show the current score of the user and the dealer. The user should be able to quit the game at any time.\n\n## Requirement Pool\n```python\n[\n    ["Implement a command-line interface for the game", "P0"],\n    ["Provide clear instructions on how to play the game", "P0"],\n    ["Display the current score of the user and the dealer", "P0"],\n    ["Ensure the game is fair and challenging", "P1"],\n    ["Allow the user to quit the game at any time", "P0"]\n]\n```\n\n## UI Design draft\nThe game will be a text-based command-line interface game. The game will start with a welcome message and instructions on how to play. The user\'s and dealer\'s scores will be displayed on the screen. The user will input their actions through the command line. The game will have a simple and clean design to ensure readability and ease of use.\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nThe main challenge in this project is to create a command-line interface for the blackjack game. We will use Python\'s built-in `input()` function to get user input and `print()` function to display the game state. We will also use Python\'s `random` module to shuffle the deck of cards.\n\nThe game logic will be encapsulated in a `Game` class, which will handle the game state and the rules of blackjack. The `Player` class will represent a player and will handle the player\'s hand of cards. The `Card` class will represent a card.\n\nWe will use `unittest` for unit testing to ensure the correctness of the game logic. For code formatting, we will use `black` and `isort`. For static type checking, we will use `mypy`. For linting, we will use `pylint`. For managing dependencies, we will use `pipenv`.\n\n## Python package name\n```python\n"cli_blackjack"\n```\n\n## File list\n```python\n[\n    "main.py",\n    "game.py",\n    "player.py",\n    "card.py",\n    "test_game.py",\n    "test_player.py",\n    "test_card.py",\n]\n```\n\n## Data structures and interface definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Game{\n        +list[Player] players\n        +list[Card] deck\n        +start_game()\n        +deal_card(Player)\n        +check_winner()\n    }\n    class Player{\n        +list[Card] hand\n        +int score\n        +hit()\n        +stand()\n    }\n    class Card{\n        +str rank\n        +str suit\n        +int value\n    }\n    Game "1" -- "*" Player: has\n    Player "1" -- "*" Card: has\n```\n\n## Program call flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant P as Player\n    M->>G: create game\n    G->>P: create players\n    M->>G: start game\n    G->>P: deal cards\n    P->>G: hit or stand\n    G->>P: deal card or check winner\n    G->>M: end game\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThe requirement is clear to me., Project Manager: ## Required Python third-party packages\n```python\n"""\nunittest==1.0.0\nblack==21.9b0\nisort==5.9.3\nmypy==0.910\npylint==2.11.1\npipenv==2021.5.29\n"""\n```\n\n## Required Other language third-party packages\n```python\n"""\nNone\n"""\n```\n\n## Full API spec\n```python\n"""\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\n  title: CLI Blackjack Game\n  version: 1.0.0\npaths:\n  /start_game:\n    post:\n      summary: Start a new game\n  /deal_card:\n    post:\n      summary: Deal a card to a player\n  /hit_or_stand:\n    post:\n      summary: Player decides to hit or stand\n  /check_winner:\n    get:\n      summary: Check the winner of the game\n"""\n```\n\n## Logic Analysis\n```python\n[\n    ["main.py", "Main entry of the program, create game and players, start and end game"],\n    ["game.py", "Game class, handle game state and rules, deal cards, check winner"],\n    ["player.py", "Player class, handle player\'s hand and score, hit and stand actions"],\n    ["card.py", "Card class, represent a card with rank, suit and value"],\n    ["test_game.py", "Unit tests for game logic"],\n    ["test_player.py", "Unit tests for player actions"],\n    ["test_card.py", "Unit tests for card representation"],\n]\n```\n\n## Task list\n```python\n[\n    "card.py",\n    "player.py",\n    "game.py",\n    "main.py",\n    "test_card.py",\n    "test_player.py",\n    "test_game.py",\n]\n```\n\n## Shared Knowledge\n```python\n"""\n\'card.py\' contains Card class which represents a card with rank, suit and value.\n\'player.py\' contains Player class which represents a player with hand and score, and hit and stand actions.\n\'game.py\' contains Game class which handles game state and rules, dealing cards and checking winner.\n\'main.py\' is the main entry of the program, it creates game and players, starts and ends game.\n"""\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThere is no unclear part.

It should be easy to start a game, with clear instructions on how to play. The game should show the current score of the user and the dealer. The user should be able to quit the game at any time.\n\n## Requirement Pool\n```python\n[\n    ["Implement a command-line interface for the game", "P0"],\n    ["Provide clear instructions on how to play the game", "P0"],\n    ["Display the current score of the user and the dealer", "P0"],\n    ["Ensure the game is fair and challenging", "P1"],\n    ["Allow the user to quit the game at any time", "P0"]\n]\n```\n\n## UI Design draft\nThe game will be a text-based command-line interface game. The game will start with a welcome message and instructions on how to play. The user\'s and dealer\'s scores will be displayed on the screen. The user will input their actions through the command line. The game will have a simple and clean design to ensure readability and ease of use.\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThere are no unclear points., Architect: ## Implementation approach\nThe main challenge in this project is to create a command-line interface for the blackjack game. We will use Python\'s built-in `input()` function to get user input and `print()` function to display the game state. We will also use Python\'s `random` module to shuffle the deck of cards.\n\nThe game logic will be encapsulated in a `Game` class, which will handle the game state and the rules of blackjack. The `Player` class will represent a player and will handle the player\'s hand of cards. The `Card` class will represent a card.\n\nWe will use `unittest` for unit testing to ensure the correctness of the game logic. For code formatting, we will use `black` and `isort`. For static type checking, we will use `mypy`. For linting, we will use `pylint`. For managing dependencies, we will use `pipenv`.\n\n## Python package name\n```python\n"cli_blackjack"\n```\n\n## File list\n```python\n[\n    "main.py",\n    "game.py",\n    "player.py",\n    "card.py",\n    "test_game.py",\n    "test_player.py",\n    "test_card.py",\n]\n```\n\n## Data structures and interface definitions\n```mermaid\nclassDiagram\n    class Game{\n        +list[Player] players\n        +list[Card] deck\n        +start_game()\n        +deal_card(Player)\n        +check_winner()\n    }\n    class Player{\n        +list[Card] hand\n        +int score\n        +hit()\n        +stand()\n    }\n    class Card{\n        +str rank\n        +str suit\n        +int value\n    }\n    Game "1" -- "*" Player: has\n    Player "1" -- "*" Card: has\n```\n\n## Program call flow\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant M as main\n    participant G as Game\n    participant P as Player\n    M->>G: create game\n    G->>P: create players\n    M->>G: start game\n    G->>P: deal cards\n    P->>G: hit or stand\n    G->>P: deal card or check winner\n    G->>M: end game\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThe requirement is clear to me., Project Manager: ## Required Python third-party packages\n```python\n"""\nunittest==1.0.0\nblack==21.9b0\nisort==5.9.3\nmypy==0.910\npylint==2.11.1\npipenv==2021.5.29\n"""\n```\n\n## Required Other language third-party packages\n```python\n"""\nNone\n"""\n```\n\n## Full API spec\n```python\n"""\nopenapi: 3.0.0\ninfo:\n  title: CLI Blackjack Game\n  version: 1.0.0\npaths:\n  /start_game:\n    post:\n      summary: Start a new game\n  /deal_card:\n    post:\n      summary: Deal a card to a player\n  /hit_or_stand:\n    post:\n      summary: Player decides to hit or stand\n  /check_winner:\n    get:\n      summary: Check the winner of the game\n"""\n```\n\n## Logic Analysis\n```python\n[\n    ["main.py", "Main entry of the program, create game and players, start and end game"],\n    ["game.py", "Game class, handle game state and rules, deal cards, check winner"],\n    ["player.py", "Player class, handle player\'s hand and score, hit and stand actions"],\n    ["card.py", "Card class, represent a card with rank, suit and value"],\n    ["test_game.py", "Unit tests for game logic"],\n    ["test_player.py", "Unit tests for player actions"],\n    ["test_card.py", "Unit tests for card representation"],\n]\n```\n\n## Task list\n```python\n[\n    "card.py",\n    "player.py",\n    "game.py",\n    "main.py",\n    "test_card.py",\n    "test_player.py",\n    "test_game.py",\n]\n```\n\n## Shared Knowledge\n```python\n"""\n\'card.py\' contains Card class which represents a card with rank, suit and value.\n\'player.py\' contains Player class which represents a player with hand and score, and hit and stand actions.\n\'game.py\' contains Game class which handles game state and rules, dealing cards and checking winner.\n\'main.py\' is the main entry of the program, it creates game and players, starts and ends game.\n"""\n```\n\n## Anything UNCLEAR\nThere is no unclear part.
