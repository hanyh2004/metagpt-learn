## Task list

- card.py
- player.py
- game.py
- main.py
- test_card.py
- test_player.py
- test_game.py

## Shared Knowledge

"""
'card.py' contains Card class which represents a card with rank, suit and value.
'player.py' contains Player class which represents a player with hand and score, and hit and stand actions.
'game.py' contains Game class which handles game state and rules, dealing cards and checking winner.
'main.py' is the main entry of the program, it creates game and players, starts and ends game.
"""


## Anything UNCLEAR

There is no unclear part. The project is well-defined and all the requirements are clear. The task list is ordered according to the dependencies between tasks. The card, player and game logic should be implemented first, then the main program, and finally the unit tests.
