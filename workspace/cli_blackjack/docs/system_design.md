## Implementation approach

The main challenge in this project is to create a command-line interface for the blackjack game. We will use Python's built-in `input()` function to get user input and `print()` function to display the game state. We will also use Python's `random` module to shuffle the deck of cards.

The game logic will be encapsulated in a `Game` class, which will handle the game state and the rules of blackjack. The `Player` class will represent a player and will handle the player's hand of cards. The `Card` class will represent a card.

We will use `unittest` for unit testing to ensure the correctness of the game logic. For code formatting, we will use `black` and `isort`. For static type checking, we will use `mypy`. For linting, we will use `pylint`. For managing dependencies, we will use `pipenv`.

## Data structures and interface definitions

    class Game{
        +list[Player] players
        +list[Card] deck
        +start_game()
        +deal_card(Player)
        +check_winner()
    }
    class Player{
        +list[Card] hand
        +int score
        +hit()
        +stand()
    }
    class Card{
        +str rank
        +str suit
        +int value
    }
    Game "1" -- "*" Player: has
    Player "1" -- "*" Card: has


## Program call flow

sequenceDiagram
    participant M as main
    participant G as Game
    participant P as Player
    M->>G: create game
    G->>P: create players
    M->>G: start game
    G->>P: deal cards
    P->>G: hit or stand
    G->>P: deal card or check winner
    G->>M: end game


## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirement is clear to me.
