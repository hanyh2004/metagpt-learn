## Implementation approach

To implement the CLI blackjack game, we will use the following open-source tools:
- Click: A popular Python package for creating command-line interfaces. It provides a simple and intuitive way to define command-line commands and options.
- PyInquirer: A Python package for creating interactive command-line interfaces. It allows us to create prompts and menus for user input.
- Colorama: A Python package for adding color and style to the command-line output. It provides an easy way to make the game visually appealing.
- Random: A built-in Python module for generating random numbers. We will use it to shuffle the deck of cards.

We will create a main.py file that will serve as the entry point for the game. This file will define the command-line commands and options using Click. It will also handle the game logic and user input using PyInquirer. The game state will be managed by a Game class, which will have methods for starting a new game, placing bets, making decisions during the game, and displaying the outcome of the game.

## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirements are clear to me.
